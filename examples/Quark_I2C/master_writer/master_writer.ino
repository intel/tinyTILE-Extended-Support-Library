/*
 *  This sketch is to demonstrate I2C writing to a device, as a bus master.  It first makes a request to
 *  write to the device.  Then proceed with write out one byte annd completed the transmission.  The sketch
 *  continues with these steps and increament the byte value each lap.  If the write operation fails, please check
 *  the connection to the external device:  verify the signals, make sure the board and the device share a
 *  common ground connection.
 *
 *  Please note:
 *    1. This sketch makes use of I2C0.  One of the two I2C connections from the Quark core.  For the ARC core I2C
 *       connection, please refer to the Wire library.
 *    2. This sketch can easily be changed to make use of I2C1 - just change to the I2C1 object instead of I2C0.
 *    3. The Quark I2C connections are not available in the Arduino 101 hardware platform.
 *    4. The sketch is accessing an external I2C device with an device number (address) of 8.  This address can be
 *       changed to fit your setup.
